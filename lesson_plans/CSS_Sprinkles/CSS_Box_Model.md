## Intro to CSS and the Box Model

### Learning Objectives

**Students will be able to...**

* Write a CSS style tag in the HTML documentâ€™s header.
* Target the intended HTML elements within their CSS file using class, id and tag selectors. 
* Change the properties of their targeted elements (color, font style, background color, background images, padding, margin, etc.) 
* Pick out fonts they like from Google fonts. Bonus!!!

### Part One: Discussion (10 minutes)

**What is CSS yo? Why do we need it?**

Cascading Style Sheets is a language which allows us to choose how we present documents to users. We use CSS to determine the colors, positioning, animations and the like for our HTML elements. 

**What is the Box Model?**

Every element is represented in a box format. There are four "types" of edges to each box. They are the:

* Content - this is the box that surrounds the actual content of the element.
* Padding - This is the next layer outside the content.
* Border - the next outlying box beyond padding.
* Margin - the empty space between this element and the nesurrounding elements.

**How do you target selected elements and apply styles to them?**

* To target elements with an id use "#" 
* To target one or more elements with the same class use "."
* To target any element that is a specific tag just type the tag name.

### Part Two: Demonstration / Code Along (10 minutes)

Take a few minutes to build some examples inside the head of the HTML file. 

Some examples you can demonstrate to a class:

* Change the color of an element
* Change the font size of an element
* Change the font color of an element
* Change the background color
* Change the margin
* Change the padding
* Add some borders

### Part Three: Lab Time (20 minutes)

* Students should go into the HTML file they created the day before.
* In the head begin to make CSS changes
* Create a CSS file and link it to your HTML page. 
* Open up your HTML file in your browser so you can see your CSS changes per save (or use the developer tools, keep in mind the changes in the dev tools do not save in your file)
* Add an img tag / use an image in an element on your blog page
* Choose three colors, make one color your background, one color your blog/entry background, and one color for your font
* Give your headers one font style and your paragraphs another font style
