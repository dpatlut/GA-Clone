## Part One
***10 minutes***

* Instructor: Talking
* Students: Listening, participating

1. Open up our blog HTML docs in Sublime & look at the tag names. Do these make sense in plain English? Can we tell what the content of a div should be based on the tag's name?

**Who created HTML? Why is it the way it is?**

HTML is a set of standards set by a group of people who decide on what the ideal interpretation of HTML is and the best implementation of it. It is up to the individual browsers to interpret the specification. This is the reason some HTML is displayed differently in different browsers.

**Semantic Markup**

What are semantic tags and what do they do?

Semantic tags are HTML tags which add information to a page without affecting the structure of the page. Although browsers will often times display some of the content in these elements a little differently, these tags are only intended to describe the content. The reason for these tags is so that external programs such as screen readers and search engines can read the content of the page more easily.

## Part Two

Letâ€™s start by refactoring our <a> tags into a navbar for our blog. Wrap some <header> and <nav> tags around the links we made yesterday.
